Ideas for future development. Some of these will be implemented in BokehJS. In no particular order:

* retina/HiDPI improvement

* code cleanup
 - should use html templates in some places
 - css files have lots of cruft
 - some places just need it

* minor ticks

* legend improvements

* annotations
 - arrows

* datetime axis

* bugs

* graphs/trees

* map projections

* computed columns, for:
 - stacking bars and areas easily
 - jitter, etc

* more efficient binary data transfers to bokehjs

* additional selection and inspection tools

* decouple selection reporting from highlighting or other policies
 - more general selections (point, line, box, poly, circle)

* out-of-tree build for js

* tests
 - unit tests
 - image comparisons

* better save capability
 - offscreen render, size choice

* demo improvements
 - code simplification
 - option for static page generation
 - more demos

* better docs/interactive gallery

* bindings in other languages

* streaming data sources
