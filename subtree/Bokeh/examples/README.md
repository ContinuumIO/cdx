This directory contains several examples of Bokeh usage.

plotting
========

This directory contains example using the high level plotting interface, and is the interface most users should want to start with.
There are three subdirectories illustrating output in three different modes:

* file - output static HTML file
* notebook - output inline in IPython notebooks
* server - out put using the Bokeh server 

Note that the server examples require the Bokeh server to be running (execute 'bokeh-server')

glyphs
======

This directory contains lower level or more advanced examples that mirror the bokehjs browser library interface. 
These exmaples are also still in the process of being improved and cleaned up. 

Notes

* All tools must be selected in the toolbar before they are active. Some common tools:
