## Forks

Mr @dustmoo (maintainer of Gridster) has his own fork of gridster.js
with some new interesting features like widget-swapping and static widgets.

Can be found here: [dustmoo/gridster.js](https://github.com/dustmoo/gridster.js)

@dustmoo is working in his spare time to merge all these changes into
ducksboard/gridster.js

If anyone would like to help @dustmoo improve his fork and reconcile
it with the main library he would be happy for the help.
