  # ## function : build_views
  # convenience function for creating a bunch of views from a spec
  # and storing them in a dictionary keyed off of model id.
  # views are automatically passed the model that they represent

  # ####Parameters
  # * mainmodel : model which is constructing the views, this is used to resolve
  #   specs into other model objects
  # * view_storage : where you want the new views stored.  this is a dictionary
  #   views will be keyed by the id of the underlying model
  # * view_specs : list of view specs.  view specs are continuum references, with
  #   a typename and an id.  you can also pass options you want to feed into
  #   the views constructor here, as an 'options' field in the dict
  # * options : any additional option to be used in the construction of views
  # * view_option : array, optional view specific options passed in to the construction of the view
